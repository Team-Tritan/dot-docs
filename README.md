### **Setting the member role**

You should probably set with member role as it allows certain commands to function properly (Such as the `lockall` command). The member role is the role you give to your members. If you don't give your members a role when joining/verifying and leave them with no roles that is perfectly fine, the member role defaults to the `@everyone` role. Set the member role role by executing `[p]memberrole [role mention/id]`
